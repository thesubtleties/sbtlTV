# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **EPG channel matching with external EPG sources** — 12-strategy matcher (exact ID through fuzzy word-overlap) enables external EPG sources like epg.pw to work alongside provider EPGs
- **Streaming XMLTV parser** — indexOf-based parser in a worker thread handles multi-GB EPG files with constant memory; two-phase parsing skips ~90% of data by filtering unmatched programmes
- **Persistent EPG mappings** — Dexie v12 `epgMappings` table stores channel-to-EPG matches with confidence levels and strategy info, surviving across syncs
- **Filtered EPG parsing** — only processes programmes for matched channels, dramatically reducing parse time and memory for large EPG files
- **Call sign extraction** — matches US/Canadian local stations by extracting call signs from channel names (WABC, KGUN, etc.) with DT suffix handling

### Fixed
- EPG programme IDs now include source ID to prevent cross-source collisions for Xtream users with multiple sources
- Single-quoted XML attributes in XMLTV files now parsed correctly (previously silently dropped)
- Hex XML entity references (`&#x2019;`) now decoded properly
- `slugify` now strips all parenthesized groups, not just the first
- `normalizeLooser` no longer mangles channel acronyms (MTV, CTV, ATV)

### Improved
- Worker thread errors now propagate meaningful messages instead of generic "exited with code 1"
- EPG sync errors return structured results with error details for debug logging
- Temp file cleanup on all error paths (download failure, decompress failure, parse failure)
- Download size limit (500MB) and decompression bomb guard (4GB) prevent disk exhaustion
- 8-minute timeout on EPG worker thread prevents indefinite hangs
- Web worker circuit breaker stops crash-recreate loops after 3 consecutive failures
- SSRF blocklist expanded with `0.0.0.0` and IPv4-mapped IPv6 patterns
- Worker diagnostic logs now route through main process debug logger (visible in production)
- Failed EPG URLs tracked and reported in multi-URL configurations

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- macOS auto-update failing silently — Squirrel.Mac's ShipIt couldn't remove quarantine xattr from a read-only `libmpv.dylib` in the asar-unpacked directory; fixed dylib permissions and excluded build-time deps from packaging
- macOS playback resilience — WebGL context recovery after GPU reset, pause/resume on sleep/wake to prevent GPU pipeline errors, stale frame clearing on channel switch
- VOD sync failures now logged to debug file (previously console-only), making issues diagnosable from exported logs
- VOD sync no longer overwrites existing movie/series counts when a fetch fails — preserves previous good data
- VOD sync timestamp only updates when at least one content type actually synced, preventing failed syncs from suppressing retries
- Xtream API responses validated as arrays before processing — prevents silent crash on non-standard server responses
- LAN blocked error message now correctly says "Settings > System > Security" matching actual UI navigation

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- M3U channels duplicated into custom groups (e.g. via IPTVEditor) now appear in all assigned categories instead of only the last one

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- macOS auto-update not applying — bundled dylibs had read-only permissions (644) which caused Squirrel.Mac's ShipIt to fail with "Permission denied" when replacing the app bundle; changed to 755

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Source priority & organization** — reorder sources with drag-and-drop to set priority; priority determines which duplicate to show for both VOD and live TV
- **VOD dedup & cross-source merging** — duplicate movies/series across sources are merged; series combine episodes across sources to gap-fill missing seasons/episodes, each episode plays from most preferred source first
- **Movie source picker** — movie detail page lists all sources a movie is available on with buttons to play from any specific source; default playback uses preferred source
- **Channel favorites** — heart icon on channels with pulse animation and glassmorphism styling; favorite channels for quick access
- **VOD watchlist** — save movies and series to a persistent watchlist with a dedicated carousel on the home page
- **Watch progress tracking** — resume playback from where you left off; progress bars on movie cards, movie detail posters, and episode rows
- **Cross-source resume** — watch progress follows content across sources using TMDB ID matching (falls back to stream ID)
- **Episode watch progress** — per-episode progress bars and watched indicators (eye-shaped blur overlay) on series detail
- **Live TV category dedup** — categories with the same name across sources are grouped into a single entry
- **Category filter for live TV** — filter channels by category in the sidebar
- **Remember selected season** — series detail preserves your season selection through collapse/play cycles
- **Hero navigation redesign** — sliding frosted-glass pill indicator with spring physics, progress fill animation, and magnetic dot repulsion effect
- **Linux mpv keybindings** — external mpv window now supports default keybindings (f=fullscreen, m=mute, arrows=seek, space=pause)

### Fixed
- VOD performance regression — limited table scans, prevented double-queries, indexed category pruning
- Virtuoso infinite loop when rendering watchlist carousel
- Volume slider snapping to 100% when dragged to zero
- mpv resume reliability — generation counter prevents stale seeks, native seek for accuracy, null guards
- Purge orphaned data from deleted sources on startup
- Filter out stale data from deleted sources in queries
- node-gyp rebuild no longer nukes bundled dylibs during macOS packaging
- PriorityTab drag handler type safety
- Watchlist sort order — oldest first, newest last (matches user expectation)

### Changed
- **VOD hook architecture** — `useVod` split into `useVodCategories`, `useVodBrowse`, and `useVod` (single-item); deleted unused `useMovies`/`useSeries`
- **VodPage data extraction** — 88 lines of hook calls moved from VodPage into dedicated `useVodHomeData` hook
- `EpisodeRow` extracted as standalone component from SeriesDetail
- VOD categories use compound primary key `[source_id+category_id]` for multi-source support
- Adaptive category strip groups categories by name across sources
- Hero buttons upgraded with premium styling, Tabler icons, and subtle lift hover effect
- MediaCard hearts use glassmorphism with Tabler icons
- Play buttons use translucent white with backdrop blur
- Detail page buttons and watchlist icons refined
- macOS code signing and notarization added to CI workflow

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- macOS code signing and notarization — builds are now signed with Developer ID Application certificate and notarized via Apple, eliminating Gatekeeper warnings and enabling auto-update

### Changed
- Release workflow passes signing credentials to macOS build via GitHub Secrets
- Hardened runtime enabled with entitlements for native addon compatibility

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-18

### Improved
- Media card hover effect — frosted glass play icon with smooth backdrop-filter transition (eliminates jank/pop)
- Play icon upgraded to Tabler player-play with rounded corners and semi-transparent frosted fill

### Refactored
- Extract shared `GenreCarouselTab` from MoviesTab/SeriesTab — eliminates ~260 lines of duplication
- Unify `matchMoviesWithTmdb`/`matchSeriesWithTmdb` into generic `matchWithTmdb<T>` — eliminates ~70 lines of duplication
- Extract shared `debugLog` utility with configurable category prefix
- Derive `supportsAutoUpdate` from sibling `isPortable`/`isLinuxNonAppImage` consts instead of recomputing from env
- Add `satisfies PlatformApi` type check to preload platform object (consistent with all other APIs)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- macOS auto-updater — `quitAndInstall(false, true)` for reliable restart instead of silent failure
- About tab now shows full update lifecycle (checking → downloading with progress → restart button) instead of static "Update available" text
- Install errors are now visible to the user instead of silently swallowed
- Linux .deb builds correctly show "View Releases on GitHub" instead of broken auto-update UI
- Update notification toast stays visible on install failure instead of vanishing

### Changed
- Auto-updater state centralized in Zustand — single listener registration eliminates conflicts between About tab and update notification
- Added `supportsAutoUpdate` platform property so UI gating is derived in one place
- Renamed `isLinuxDeb` to `isLinuxNonAppImage` for accuracy (covers all non-AppImage Linux builds)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Adjustable guide appearance** — category sidebar width and background opacity sliders in Settings → EPG

### Fixed
- macOS auto-updater now works — added zip build target required by electron-updater
- Release workflow uploads macOS zip to GitHub release assets
- Opacity stacking flicker — EPG panel uses positioning instead of padding when categories are visible, preventing double-layer opacity overlap during transitions

### Changed
- **Settings architecture** — all app settings consolidated into Zustand store, hydrated once at startup. Eliminates redundant IPC calls (previously each component independently fetched settings from disk). Settings changes are now reactive across the app.
- Settings tab renamed from "Channels" to "EPG" with new Guide Appearance section
- Settings content area is now scrollable with a styled scrollbar
- Sort order dropdown themed to match other settings controls

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Native in-window video on macOS** - Video now renders directly inside the app window using a native mpv-texture addon with GPU-accelerated IOSurface sharing (replaces external mpv window)
- Screen sleep prevention during video playback on all platforms
- macOS: `which mpv` PATH fallback for non-standard installs (MacPorts, Nix, custom prefix)

### Fixed
- Mutex lock ordering in native mpv context to prevent potential deadlock
- WebGL draw errors now logged with throttling and context loss detection
- Native texture bridge escalates to error callback after 5 consecutive frame failures
- Render thread fires error callback if GL context initialization fails
- IPC handlers wrapped in try-catch with debug logging
- Partial bridge destroyed on init failure (resource leak fix)
- Comment inaccuracies corrected across native addon
- Unified MpvStatus types across native bridge, preload, and UI layers
- Removed duplicate dependency and redundant addon import

### Changed
- macOS builds are now **arm64 (Apple Silicon) only** — Intel Mac support discontinued
- macOS no longer bundles an external mpv binary — uses native addon with system mpv as fallback
- CI workflows updated for native addon build pipeline (brew + node-gyp + dylib bundling)
